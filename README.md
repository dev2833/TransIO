# ICU MessageFormat Helper

The ICU MessageFormat Helper is a powerful Chrome extension designed to assist linguists, translators, and developers in creating accurate and valid ICU MessageFormat strings. This tool is particularly useful for those working with complex ICU structures, including plurals, selects, gender, and other advanced message formatting rules.

## Installation
>Make sure you have Node.js version **above 16.17.0** and **below 20.x** installed.

Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kitty885/message_format
```
Go to the `message_format` directory and run

```
npm install
```
Now build the extension using
```
npm run build
```
You will see a `build` folder generated inside `[PROJECT_HOME]`

To avoid running `npm build` after updating any file, you can run

```
npm run watch
```

which listens to any local file changes, and rebuilds automatically.

## Adding Message_Format extension toÂ Chrome

In the Chrome browser, go to chrome://extensions page and switch on developer mode. This enables the ability to locally install a Chrome extension.

## Using SASS

Boilerplate contains [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader), so you can use SASS instead of pure CSS in your project. To do so:
1. Rename ```src/App.css``` file to ```src/App.scss``` 
2. Change import line in ```src/app.js``` from 
 ```import './App.css';```  to ```import './App.scss';```
