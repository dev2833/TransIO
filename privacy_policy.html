        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy describes how the ICU MessageFormat Helper extension (the "Extension") handles your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users. All operations, such as
            detecting and parsing ICU MessageFormat strings, are performed locally on your device without communicating
            with external servers.</p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>The Extension processes ICU MessageFormat strings and translation data directly within the browser and does
            not share or transmit any of this data outside of your local environment.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>No third-party services are used by this Extension, and no personal data is shared with external services or
            platforms.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Since no user data is collected, stored, or transmitted by this Extension, no specific security measures are
            needed beyond the browserâ€™s built-in security features.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us <a
